# GEO Platform Optimizer

## Core Insight

Only **11% of domains** are cited by BOTH ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews for the same query. Each AI search platform uses different indexes, ranking logic, and source preferences. A page optimized for Google AI Overviews may be invisible to ChatGPT, and vice versa. Platform-specific optimization is not optional — it is the foundation of any serious GEO strategy.

## How to Use This Skill

1. Collect the target URL and the site's primary topic/industry
2. Run each platform checklist below against the site
3. Score each platform on the 0-100 rubric
4. Generate GEO-PLATFORM-OPTIMIZATION.md with per-platform scores, gaps, and action items

## Platform 1: Google AI Overviews (AIO)

### How AIO Selects Sources
- 92% of AIO citations come from pages already ranking in the **top 10 organic results** — traditional SEO is the gateway
- However, 47% of citations come from pages ranking **below position 5** — AIO has its own selection logic favoring clarity and directness over raw rank
- AIO strongly favors pages with **clean structure, direct answers, and scannable formatting**
- Featured snippet optimization has ~70% overlap with AIO optimization
- AIO prefers **concise, factual, unambiguous answers** — hedging and filler reduce citation probability

### Optimization Checklist

1. **Question-Based Headings**: Use H2/H3 headings phrased as questions matching real user queries. Check Google's "People Also Ask" for the target topic and mirror those exact phrasings.
2. **Direct Answer in First Paragraph**: After each question heading, provide a clear 1-2 sentence answer immediately. Then expand with supporting detail. The first sentence should be a standalone citation candidate.
3. **Tables and Structured Comparisons**: AIO heavily cites tables. Convert any comparison, pricing, specification, or feature data into HTML tables. Use clear column headers.
4. **Ordered and Unordered Lists**: Step-by-step processes should use ordered lists. Feature lists should use unordered lists. AIO extracts these directly.
5. **FAQ Sections**: Add a dedicated FAQ section with 5-10 real questions. Use proper H3 headings for each question. While FAQPage schema rich results are restricted to govt/health sites since Aug 2023, the content pattern still helps AIO extraction.
6. **Definitions and Glossary Boxes**: For any industry-specific term, provide a clear definition. Format: "**[Term]** is [concise definition]." AIO frequently cites definitions.
7. **Statistics with Sources**: Include specific numbers with attribution. "According to [Source], [statistic]." AIO prefers citeable, specific claims over vague assertions.
8. **Publication Date**: Include a visible publication date and last-updated date. AIO deprioritizes undated content for time-sensitive queries.
9. **Author Byline**: Display author name with credentials. Link to an author page with bio, credentials, and sameAs links.
10. **Page Depth**: Keep target pages within 3 clicks of homepage. AIO rarely cites deep, orphaned content.

## Platform 2: ChatGPT Web Search

### How ChatGPT Selects Sources
- Uses **Bing's search index** as its foundation (not Google)
- Top citation sources by domain share: **Wikipedia (47.9%)**, Reddit (11.3%), YouTube, major news outlets
- ChatGPT heavily weights **entity recognition** — if your brand exists as a structured entity (Wikipedia, Wikidata, Crunchbase), it is far more likely to be cited
- Prefers **authoritative, well-established sources** over new or niche sites
- Longer, more comprehensive articles get cited more often than short pieces
- ChatGPT tends to cite **the most canonical source** for a claim rather than the original

### Optimization Checklist

1. **Wikipedia Presence**: Check if the brand/person/product has a Wikipedia article. If not, assess notability criteria. If notable, create a draft. If an article exists, ensure it is accurate and current.
2. **Wikidata Entity**: Verify the entity exists on Wikidata (wikidata.org). If not, create a Wikidata item with key properties: instance of, official website, social media links, founding date, headquarters location.
3. **Bing Webmaster Tools**: Verify the site is registered in Bing Webmaster Tools. Submit sitemap. Check for crawl errors.
4. **Bing Index Coverage**: Use `site:domain.com` on Bing to verify key pages are indexed. Bing may have different indexed pages than Google.
5. **Reddit Authority**: Check for brand mentions on Reddit. Identify relevant subreddits. Assess whether the brand participates authentically in discussions.
6. **YouTube Presence**: Verify YouTube channel exists with relevant content. Video descriptions should contain full URLs and entity information.
7. **Authoritative Backlinks**: ChatGPT/Bing weight .edu, .gov, and major publication backlinks heavily. Audit backlink profile for these sources.
8. **Entity Consistency**: Brand name, founding date, leadership, and key facts must be consistent across Wikipedia, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, and the official website.
9. **Comprehensive Content**: Pages targeting ChatGPT citation should be **2000+ words** with thorough topic coverage. ChatGPT prefers single authoritative sources over combining multiple thin pages.
10. **Clear Attribution**: Include "About" sections, company descriptions, and founding stories. ChatGPT uses these for entity grounding.

### Scoring Rubric (0-100)

| Criterion | Points | How to Score |
|---|---|---|
| Wikipedia article exists and is accurate | 20 | 20 if exists, 10 if stub, 0 if none |
| Wikidata entity with 5+ properties | 10 | 10 if complete, 5 if basic, 0 if none |
| Bing index coverage of key pages | 10 | 10 if full, 5 if partial, 0 if poor |
| Reddit brand mentions (positive) | 10 | 10 if active discussions, 5 if mentions, 0 if none |
| YouTube channel with relevant content | 10 | 10 if active, 5 if present but sparse, 0 if none |
| Authoritative backlinks (.edu, .gov, press) | 15 | 3 points per authoritative backlink category, max 15 |
| Entity consistency across platforms | 10 | 10 if consistent, 5 if minor discrepancies, 0 if major |
| Content comprehensiveness (2000+ words) | 10 | 10 if thorough, 5 if adequate, 0 if thin |
| Bing Webmaster Tools configured | 5 | 5 if verified, 0 if not |

## Platform 3: Perplexity AI

### How Perplexity Selects Sources
- Top citation sources: **Reddit (46.7%)**, Wikipedia, YouTube, major publications
- Perplexity places the **heaviest emphasis on community validation** of all AI search platforms
- Strongly favors **discussion threads** where claims are debated, validated, or expanded by multiple participants
- Prefers recent content — publication date is a strong ranking signal
- Cites **multiple sources per answer** (typically 5-15), so there is more opportunity for mid-authority sites to appear
- Uses its own crawling infrastructure in addition to search APIs

### Optimization Checklist

1. **Active Reddit Presence**: The brand or its representatives should participate authentically in relevant subreddit discussions. Not promotional — helpful, specific, and community-oriented.
2. **Reddit AMAs and Threads**: Encourage or participate in AMAs, detailed discussion threads, and community Q&As. Perplexity treats these as high-signal content.
3. **Forum and Community Presence**: Beyond Reddit, check Hacker News, Stack Overflow, Quora, and niche industry forums. Perplexity indexes these heavily.
4. **Discussion-Friendly Content**: Publish content that invites discussion — opinion pieces, research findings, contrarian takes, original data. Content that gets shared and debated in communities ranks higher.
5. **Freshness Signals**: Publish content with clear dates. Update content regularly. Perplexity deprioritizes stale content more aggressively than other platforms.
6. **Multiple Source Validation**: Claims in your content should be supported by other sources. Perplexity cross-references and prefers claims it can verify from multiple origins.
7. **YouTube Video Content**: Create video content that Perplexity can reference. Ensure video titles, descriptions, and transcripts contain target information.
8. **Direct, Quotable Passages**: Write paragraphs that can stand alone as citations. Each paragraph should make one clear point with supporting evidence.
9. **Original Data and Research**: Publish original surveys, benchmarks, case studies, or datasets. Perplexity heavily favors primary sources.
10. **Perplexity Pages**: Check if Perplexity has created a "Page" about your topic/brand. These are curated summaries that influence future citations.

### Scoring Rubric (0-100)

| Criterion | Points | How to Score |
|---|---|---|
| Active Reddit presence in relevant subreddits | 20 | 20 if active contributor, 10 if mentioned, 0 if absent |

## Platform 4: Google Gemini

### How Gemini Selects Sources
- Uses **Google's search index** plus strong weighting toward **Google-owned properties**
- YouTube content is weighted significantly more heavily than in standard Google Search
- Google Business Profile data is directly accessible to Gemini
- Gemini uses Google's Knowledge Graph directly — entity presence in Knowledge Graph is a major advantage
- Structured data (Schema.org) is consumed directly by Gemini for entity understanding
- Gemini multi-modal: can reference images, videos, and text together

### Optimization Checklist

1. **Google Knowledge Panel**: Check if the brand has a Google Knowledge Panel. If not, claim it through Google Business Profile or structured data. Ensure all information is accurate.
2. **Google Business Profile**: Complete and optimize GBP with all fields: hours, services, photos, posts, Q&A. Gemini pulls directly from GBP for local queries.
3. **YouTube Strategy**: Create YouTube content for every key topic. Optimize titles, descriptions, timestamps, and closed captions. Gemini cites YouTube more than any other AI platform.
4. **YouTube Chapters and Timestamps**: Use chapters (timestamps in description) so Gemini can reference specific segments of videos.
5. **Google Merchant Center**: For e-commerce, ensure products are in Google Merchant Center. Gemini references product data directly.
6. **Structured Data (Schema.org)**: Implement comprehensive Schema.org markup. Gemini uses this for entity understanding more aggressively than other platforms.
7. **Google Sites Ecosystem**: Ensure presence across Google ecosystem: Google Scholar (for research), Google News (for publishers), Google Maps (for local).
8. **Image Optimization**: Gemini is multi-modal. Use descriptive alt text, structured image filenames, and high-quality images. Include relevant images with every piece of content.
9. **Google E-E-A-T Signals**: All standard Google E-E-A-T signals apply with extra weight. Author pages, about pages, editorial policies, and expertise demonstrations.
10. **Chrome Web Store / Google Workspace Marketplace**: For software companies, presence on Google platforms adds entity signals.

## Platform 5: Bing Copilot

### How Copilot Selects Sources
- Uses **Bing's search index** (shared infrastructure with ChatGPT but different ranking/selection)
- Supports **IndexNow protocol** for near-instant indexing of new and updated content
- Copilot tends to cite **fewer sources per answer** (typically 3-5) but gives more prominent attribution
- Microsoft ecosystem integration: LinkedIn, GitHub, Microsoft Learn content is weighted
- Copilot prefers pages with clear, structured markup and fast load times

### Optimization Checklist

1. **Bing Webmaster Tools**: Register and verify site. Submit XML sitemap. Review and fix any crawl issues.
2. **IndexNow Implementation**: Implement the IndexNow protocol to notify Bing of content changes in real-time. Submit a key file at `/.well-known/indexnow-key.txt` and ping the IndexNow API on content publish/update.
3. **LinkedIn Company Page**: Ensure the company LinkedIn page is complete with accurate description, employee connections, and regular posts. Copilot indexes LinkedIn content.
4. **GitHub Presence**: For tech companies, maintain an active GitHub presence. Copilot references GitHub repos, documentation, and README files.
5. **Microsoft Learn / Documentation**: If relevant, contribute to Microsoft Learn or ensure documentation is compatible with Microsoft's documentation standards.
6. **Bing Places for Business**: Equivalent to Google Business Profile. Complete all fields for local search visibility in Copilot.
7. **Clear Meta Descriptions**: Bing/Copilot weights meta descriptions more heavily than Google does. Write compelling, keyword-rich meta descriptions for every page.
8. **Social Signals**: Bing has historically weighted social signals (shares, likes, engagement) more than Google. Maintain active social media presence.
9. **Exact-Match Keywords**: Bing's algorithm is more literal about keyword matching than Google. Include exact target phrases in titles, headings, and body content.
10. **Fast Page Load**: Copilot deprioritizes slow pages. Target sub-2-second load time. Optimize images, enable compression, minimize render-blocking resources.
