description: >
  Monthly delta tracking and progress reporting for GEO clients. Compares two
  GEO audits (baseline vs. current), calculates score improvements across all
  categories, tracks action item completion, and generates a "here's your progress"
  client report. Use when user says "compare", "delta", "monthly report", "progress",
  "confronta", "progressi", "report mensile", or when running a monthly client check-in.

# GEO Monthly Delta Report Generator

## Purpose

The single most powerful retention tool for a GEO agency: show clients **exactly**
what improved since they started working with you. Every point gained on the GEO
score is proof of value. This skill generates the "here's your progress" report.

---

## Commands

```
/geo compare <domain>
/geo compare <baseline-file> <current-file>
/geo compare electron-srl.com --month march-2026
```

**Examples:**
```
/geo compare electron-srl.com
/geo compare ~/.geo-prospects/audits/electron-srl.com-2026-01-15.md ~/.geo-prospects/audits/electron-srl.com-2026-03-12.md
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Find Audit Files

If only domain is provided:
1. Look in `~/.geo-prospects/audits/` for files matching `<domain>-*.md`
2. Sort by date
3. Use oldest as baseline, newest as current
4. If only one file exists: use it as baseline, run a fresh quick audit as current
5. If no files exist: suggest running `/geo prospect audit <domain>` first

### Step 2: Parse Both Audits

Extract from each audit file:
- Overall GEO Score
- Per-category scores (6 categories)
- Per-platform scores (5 platforms)
- AI crawler status (14 crawlers)
- Critical issues list
- Action items list with status

### Step 3: Calculate Deltas

For each metric:
- Delta = Current - Baseline
- Trend = ▲ (improved), ▼ (declined), ── (unchanged)
- Color coding in report: green (+), red (-), gray (=)

### Step 4: Generate Monthly Report

Output to `~/.geo-prospects/reports/<domain>-monthly-<date>.md`

## Report Template

Generate the following document:

```markdown
# GEO Monthly Progress Report
## [COMPANY NAME] — [MONTH YEAR]

**Reporting period:** [BASELINE DATE] → [CURRENT DATE]
**Prepared by:** [AGENCY NAME]
**Report reference:** GEO-MONTHLY-[DOMAIN]-[YYMMDD]

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences: What improved, what's the trend, what to focus on next month.]

Example: "Electron Srl's GEO Score improved from 32 to 44 this month (+12 points),
placing the site firmly in the 'Below Average' tier and on track to reach 'Moderate'
by May. The biggest wins were AI crawler access (+3 crawlers now allowed) and schema
implementation (+Organization and LocalBusiness schemas live). Next month's focus is
content citability — the highest-weighted remaining gap."

## Estimated Business Impact

Based on the [X]-point improvement this month:

- **AI citation likelihood:** Increased by approximately [X]%
- **Crawlers with access:** [X]/14 → [Y]/14 (better coverage on [platforms])
- **Estimated monthly AI-referred traffic improvement:** +[X]% (conservative)
- **Traffic value at current conversion rates:** +€[X]/month in organic value

*Note: Full traffic impact from GEO changes typically takes 4-8 weeks to materialize
as AI platforms re-index and update their knowledge bases.*

## Delta Calculation Logic

When parsing two audit files, look for these patterns:

```
Score markers to extract:
- "GEO Score: XX/100"
- "Overall Score: XX"
- "AI Citability: XX/100"
- "Brand Authority: XX/100"
- "Technical: XX/100"
- "Schema: XX/100"
- "Platform: XX/100"
- "Content: XX/100"
- "GPTBot: Allowed/Blocked"
- "ClaudeBot: Allowed/Blocked"
```

If exact scores are not found in audit files, use contextual analysis of the
written findings to estimate approximate scores based on issues described.

---

## Trend Interpretation

| Delta | Trend Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| +5 or more | ▲▲ | Strong improvement |
| +1 to +4 | ▲ | Improvement |
| 0 | ── | No change |
| -1 to -4 | ▼ | Slight decline |
| -5 or more | ▼▼ | Significant decline — needs discussion |

A decline is not necessarily bad — it can mean new issues were discovered in the
fresh audit that weren't visible before. Frame declines as "newly discovered opportunities."
