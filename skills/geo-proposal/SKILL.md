## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Audit Data

1. Check if `~/.geo-prospects/audits/<domain>*.md` exists
2. If not, suggest running `/geo quick <domain>` first
3. Extract from audit:
   - GEO Score (overall and per-category)
   - Top 3 critical findings
   - Quick wins list
   - Business type
   - Estimated organic traffic impact

### Step 2: Customize the Proposal

Auto-fill proposal template with:
- Company name (from domain or prospect record)
- GEO score and tier label
- 3 most critical pain points (translated to business language)
- Estimated revenue at risk from AI search shift
- Recommended service tier based on score:
  - Score 0-40 → Recommend Premium (critical issues need full attention)
  - Score 41-60 → Recommend Standard (significant gaps, needs monthly work)
  - Score 61-75 → Recommend Basic (solid base, needs monitoring)

### Step 3: Generate Proposal File

Output to `~/.geo-prospects/proposals/<domain>-proposal-<date>.md`
Also update prospect record if it exists in `~/.geo-prospects/prospects.json`
