## Orchestration Instructions

### `/geo prospect new <domain>`

1. Check if `~/.geo-prospects/prospects.json` exists, create if not (empty array)
2. Auto-detect company name from domain (e.g., `electron-srl.com` → `Electron Srl`)
3. Assign next sequential ID: `PRO-001`, `PRO-002`, etc.
4. Ask user for:
   - Contact name (optional)
   - Contact email
   - Monthly contract value estimate (optional)
5. Set status to `lead`
6. Save to JSON file
7. Suggest next step: "Run `/geo prospect audit electron-srl.com` to score this prospect"

### `/geo prospect list`

Read `~/.geo-prospects/prospects.json` and render a summary table:
